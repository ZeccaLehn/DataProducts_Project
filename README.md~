### Rediscover Probability through Interactive Statistics

Using the provided sliders, and manipulating three linked distributions, the user can generate unique probabilities for the  **kernel histogram** (by `Breaks`), **normal distribution**, and **kernel distribution** together. Use the `Tau` function to generate probabilities for non-normal distributions--skewed to the right. With use of the `Probability` slider, set a range of confidence around **X values** -- these are generated randomly by the `N` count slider. If you want to test how breaks within a histogram given a certain N count effect probability, go right ahead!
